# SimpleDB WebView

SimpleDB WebView is a web-based browser for SimpleDB databases with a clean UI. The backend communication is done with [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) and the [simpledb](https://github.com/rjrodger/simpledb) module.

## Current limitations

* WebView can only read data
* No pagination - only the first 1000 items are shown at a time
