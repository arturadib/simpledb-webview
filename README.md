# SimpleDB WebView

SimpleDB WebView is a web-based browser and explorer for SimpleDB databases with a clean UI. The backend communication is done with [Node.js](https://github.com/joyent/node) and the [simpledb](https://github.com/rjrodger/simpledb) module.

_This project is at a very early stage. It's probably buggy. Contributions are welcome!_
